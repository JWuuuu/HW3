This repository contains the deliverables for Individual Homework 3 (HW3) in CSE360. The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate standalone automated testing for five selected methods from the QuestionsManager class, along with complete Javadoc documentation and a screencast demonstration.

🧪 What’s in this Project?

A standalone test class: HW3.java

Source classes tested:

QuestionsManager.java

Question.java

User.java

Javadoc output generated using Oracle-style documentation

Screencast explaining the five test cases and Javadoc

✅ Tested Methods

From QuestionsManager.java:

deleteQuestion(int questionId)

deleteQuestion(int questionId, User currentUser)

updateQuestionTitle(int questionId, String newTitle)

searchQuestions(String keyword)

Each method is tested independently using console output for verification.
